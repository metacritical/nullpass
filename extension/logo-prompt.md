# Logo Design Prompt for NullPass

## Primary Prompt

**Create a modern, minimalist logo for NullPass - a stateless password manager browser extension. The logo should convey security, simplicity, and the concept of "null" or "nothing" while being professional and trustworthy.**

## Core Concept Elements

**Visual Metaphors to Incorporate:**
- A lock/keyhole that's empty or transparent (representing "null")
- Minimalist design with negative space
- Clean geometric shapes
- Subtle tech/security symbolism
- Modern gradient or solid color approach

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Deep purple to indigo gradient (#667eea â†’ #764ba2)
- Secondary: Clean white/light gray for contrast
- Accent: Bright blue or green for highlights
- Must work well in both light and dark themes

## Technical Requirements

**Format & Usage:**
- Vector format (SVG) for scalability
- Must work at multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
- High contrast for visibility in browser toolbar
- Monochrome version for fallback scenarios
- Transparent background

**Design Style:**
- Flat design with subtle depth (optional)
- No 3D effects or overly complex details
- Recognizable even at small sizes
- Professional, not playful or cartoonish
- Tech-forward but approachable

## Creative Directions

### Option 1: "Null Lock"
- An outline of a padlock with the center being transparent/empty
- The lock shape suggests security, the emptiness suggests "null"
- Clean, geometric lines with modern styling

### Option 2: "Zero Key"
- A key shape where the teeth form a "0" or empty circle
- Combines access (key) with the concept of nothing/null
- Minimalist and clever visual metaphor

### Option 3: "Abstract N"
- A stylized letter "N" that incorporates lock/keyhole elements
- Negative space creates the security symbol
- Modern, typographic approach

### Option 4: "Portal/Gate"
- A circular or square frame that's empty inside
- Represents a secure gateway that needs no storage
- Clean, architectural feel

## Design Principles

**Must Avoid:**
- Overly complex details that get lost at small sizes
- Generic lock icons that don't convey "null"
- Playful or cartoon elements
- Too many colors or gradients
- Text/words in the logo

**Should Emphasize:**
- Simplicity and clarity
- Security and trustworthiness  
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- The unique "stateless" concept
- Instant recognizability

3. **Monochrome** - Single color version for various UI contexts
4. **Dark Mode** - Optimized version for dark backgrounds
5. **SVG Source** - Editable vector file

## Success Criteria
